      "5. **Content Validation**: Ensure questions are appropriate for computer vision students\n",
      "\n",
      "## Analysis Guidelines\n",
      "- **Cognitive Level**: Assess if questions are too easy, too hard, or just right\n",
      "- **Language Complexity**: Check vocabulary and sentence structure\n",
      "- **Question Clarity**: Ensure questions are unambiguous and well-written\n",
      "- **Option Quality**: Verify distractors are plausible but clearly incorrect\n",
      "- **Educational Value**: Confirm questions promote learning and understanding\n",
      "\n",
      "## Enhancement Instructions\n",
      "- If questions are too complex: Simplify language and reduce difficulty\n",
      "- If questions are too simple: Increase complexity and add analytical elements\n",
      "- If tone is inappropriate: Adjust to match student age and subject level\n",
      "- If grammar is poor: Correct all grammatical and punctuation errors\n",
      "- If explanations are unclear: Improve clarity and educational value\n",
